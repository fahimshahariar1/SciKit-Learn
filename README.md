# SciKit-Learn

Scikit learn is again another very important machine learning library.
Scikit learn or sklearn is basically the start of machine learning. Till now what we have learned in Pandas and Numpy and Matplotlib. We will be using all of these in sklearn to get our desired results.

Sklearn has lots of tools that we will use to make predictions of our data and build models to refine those prediction.

This will be a very interesting topic we might get overwhelmed but remember not to give up
