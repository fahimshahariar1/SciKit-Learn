We saw a glimpse in the last lesson that there might be missing values in your data.
and which might cause some issues when you are working with them they will give you errors

2. fixing them using Scilit-learn
In order to change or fill the mising values using Scikit learn we need to first split the data into X & y using the train_est_split module
