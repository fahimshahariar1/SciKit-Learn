We saw a glimpse in the last lesson that there might be missing values in your data.
and which might cause some issues when you are working with them they will give you errors

There are ways that we can fix them.

1. fixing them by using pandas

To Fix them with pandas we can just simply use the replace method to change the values to "missing" if they are integer and use the mean() function if its integer type

2. fixing them using Scilit-learn
In order to change or fill the mising values using Scikit learn we need to first split the data into X & y using the train_est_split module

The we will import two modules SimpleImputer and ColumnTransformer
SimpleImputer is basically a helping hand who imputes or makes the changes and Columntransformer well as its name it transforms the columns
cat_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing")
door_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value=4)
num_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")

We first created 3 imputers who will impute based ont he categorical features
