So we have covered a lot till now. Up next we will move to our point no 3. Do you remember? if not no worries we can check back again
  1. Getting the data ready
2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm/model for our problems
3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
4. Evaluating a model
5. Improve a model
6. Save and load a trained model
7. Putting it all together

Today we are going to look at 3. Fit the model and use it to make predictions.
Now you might think that we have already done it. Yes, we have but now we are going to look into this in a bit more depth

So we have fit the model using the .fit function but when it comes to predictions it can be done in three ways 
1. the way we did till now which is using the score() function
2. using .predict 
3. using predict_proba
