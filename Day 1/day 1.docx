Scikit-learn is a very powerful library that we can use to create different estimators/models/algorithms

But there is certain workflow that we will be following to work with Scikit learn. Those are
1. Getting the data ready
  - We will first of all create the data or get the data ready. It could be by using Pandas and Numpy or by some predefined data

2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm/model for our problems
- Scikit-learn or sklearn has lots of tools and algorithms, but we need to find what algorithm would be the best fit for our data

3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
- Then we will need to fit the model or algorithm in the data to find out possible patterns from the data 

4. Evaluating a model
- Then we will need to evaluate if the model is working or accuracy of our given data

5. Improve a model
- and if needed we will have to improve the model as well

6. Save and load a trained model
- Then save the model and load the trained model where needed. which we have created by improving it according to our data
