In the previous lesson, we learned that we need to follow some workflows to work with Scikit-learn.
Now we will look in depth at each of the workflow's points.
Starting with Getting the data ready

Most of the time the data that we will have usually will not be ready to use. So we will need to make it ready to use.
To do so we need to follow 3 main things.
1. Split the data into features and label (X & y)
2. Filling/imputing or disregarding missing values
3. Converting non-numerical values to numerical values also known as features encoding
