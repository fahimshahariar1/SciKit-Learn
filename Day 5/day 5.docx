As we have shared in the first lesson we need to follow a particular flow when we are working with SciKit-learn
If you have forgotten 
1. Getting the data ready
2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm/model for our problems
3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
4. Evaluating a model
5. Improve a model
6. Save and load a trained model
7. Putting it all together

This is what I am talking about.

So we have worked with point 1. which is getting the data ready now we are going to look into Choosing the right estimators/algorithms/model

If you are someone like me who doesn't know which model or algorithm to choose for different types of datasets then you can follow https://scikit-learn.org/stable/machine_learning_map.html this link, where Scikit learn has map created for you to understand and select the correct algorithm based on your needs.
So, Let's get started

Previously for datasets, we used our own dataset but this time we are going to use a real-world dataset from SciKit_learn
To do so, we are going to use the fetch_california_housing module of sklearn which you can find here https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html
