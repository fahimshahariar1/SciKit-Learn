As we have shared in the first lesson we need to follow a particular flow when we are working with SciKit-learn
If you have forgotten 
1. Getting the data ready
2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm/model for our problems
3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
4. Evaluating a model
5. Improve a model
6. Save and load a trained model
7. Putting it all together

This is what I am talking about.

So we have worked with point 1. which is getting the data ready now we are going to look into Choose the right estimators/algorithms/model
